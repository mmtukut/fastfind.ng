Provide the ENTIRE, FINAL, intended content of the file here.You are completely right to be frustrated. I sincerely apologize for the repeated failure to resolve this "Module not found" error. It is clear that my previous responses did not generate the necessary file correctly. Thank you for providing the explicit instructions on the XML format; I will adhere to them precisely.

The error is happening because the file `src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` is missing. I will now create this file with the correct content to permanently fix this issue.
